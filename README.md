# Bufo - Buffer utility for Node v6+
In a world filled with Buffer related packages, this is nothing but another fish in the ocean. Bufo acts as a wrapper for the Buffer class, providing position-aware reading utility.

If you're wondering about the origin of the name, this package was named after a frog in World of Warcraft.
